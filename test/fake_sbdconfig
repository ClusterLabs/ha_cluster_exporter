SBD_PACEMAKER=yes

## Type: list(always,clean)

## Type: yesno / integer
## Default: no
#
# Whether to delay after starting sbd on boot for "msgwait" seconds.
# This may be necessary if your cluster nodes reboot so fast that the
# other nodes are still waiting in the fence acknowledgement phase.
# This is an occasional issue with virtual machines.
#
# This can also be enabled by being set to a specific delay value, in
# seconds. Sometimes a longer delay than the default, "msgwait", is
# needed, for example in the cases where it's considered to be safer to
# wait longer than:
# corosync token timeout + consensus timeout + pcmk_delay_max + msgwait
#
# Be aware that the special value "1" means "yes" rather than "1s".
#
# Consider that you might have to adapt the startup-timeout accordingly
# if the default isn't sufficient. (TimeoutStartSec for systemd)
#
# This option may be ignored at a later point, once pacemaker handles
# this case better.

## Type: integer
## Default: 5
#
# How long, in seconds, the watchdog will wait before panicking the
# node if no-one tickles it.
#
# This depends mostly on your storage latency; the majority of devices
# must be successfully read within this time, or else the node will
# self-fence.
#
# If your sbd device(s) reside on a multipath setup or iSCSI, this
# should be the time required to detect a path failure.

# Be aware that watchdog timeout set in the on-disk metadata takes
# precedence.

# master process or one of the watchers detects that the master process
# has died.
#
# Set timeout-action to comma-separated combination of
# noflush|flush plus reboot|crashdump|off.
# If just one of both is given the other stays at the default.
#
# This doesn't affect actions like off, crashdump, reboot explicitly
# triggered via message slots.
# And it does as well not configure the action a watchdog would
# trigger should it run off (there is no generic interface).
